This a fork from nicolas c zakas repository. I am adding a few more now. All are written in pure javascript. To execute just copy the code and paste it in the browser console( For chrome press ctrl+shift+j ). new ones are
- data-structures/trie
- algorithms/finding sub matrix with biggest sum from matrix of integers(from cracking the coding interview) page 92 5th edition
- algorithms/goGameIsOver.js , algorithm to check if a go game is over i.e 
given a boolean matrix, write a code to find if an island of 0's is completely surrounded by 1's.
- algorithms.prefixParsing to parse prefix polish notation
- algorithms/sepObjectsInBitmap.js algorithm to find seperate objects in bitmap( object refers to a continious neighbourhood of zeros)
- algorithms/sumToHundred.js algorithm to find out which possible combinations of 9 digits and symbols + , - or nothing sum to hundred. ex - 12-3-4+5-6+7+89 = 100
